# Decentralized-Wallet-Project

This project repo aims to create a best self-custodial wallet solution for the wider community.

[Background/Problem Setting]

Centralized Custodians that are widely in use in the crypto space today often 1) lacks transparency, and/or 2) have a single point of failure.
Word usage is not strictly enforced either. While advertising as a "self-custodial" solution, some custodians keep the private key or equivalent as part of the wallet scheme. While calling "cold wallets", some custodians keep shards of a private key or equivalent online.

[Primary Purpose of this Decentralized Wallet Project]

This project is missioned to deliver a wallet service that is transparent about its use of language, wallet structure and risk profiles. This project works towards eliminating a single point of failure, however, does not promise to deliver this.

[Secondary Purpose of this Decentralized Wallet Project]

This project ideally plan to add a functionality where a wallet user can initiate an issuance of a unique cryptocurrency, manage its circulation, and use this cryptocurrency in every day life. The last part assumes that the crypto infrastructure will develope over time.
