# Decentralized-Wallet-Project

This project repo aims to create a best self-custodial wallet solution for the wider community.

[Primary Purpose of this Decentralized Wallet Project]

This project is missioned to deliver a wallet service that is transparent about its use of language, wallet structure and risk profiles. This project works towards eliminating a single point of failure, however, does not promise to deliver this.

[Secondary Purpose of this Decentralized Wallet Project]

This project ideally plans to add a functionality where a wallet user can initiate an issuance of a unique cryptocurrency, manage its circulation, and use this cryptocurrency in every day life. The last part assumes that the crypto infrastructure will develope over time.

[Background/Problem Setting]

Centralized Custodians that are widely in use in the crypto space today often 1) lacks transparency, and/or 2) have a single point of failure.
Word usage is not strictly enforced either. While advertising as a "self-custodial" solution, some custodians keep the private key or equivalent as part of their wallet scheme. While calling "cold wallets", some custodians keep shards of a private key or equivalent online. And the code that governs these secretly held keys or equivalent is obviously closed-sourced.

[Cryptocurrency Exchanges as Centralized Custodians]

Cryptocurrency Exchanges operations vary depending on jurisdictions in which the exchanges are located. At the bottom line, trading and custody are two fundamentally different fields that require expertise, and exchange employees usually do not have the best insight in custodial security. Neither can a retail user be allowed to inspect and audit exchange operations, limiting the transparency of exchange operations.
The most basic form of exchange wallet usually does not provide a multi-signatory scheme to retail users.

[Case Studies]

Qredo - Qredo prvodies a WEB UI and a mobile app allowing users to form a multi-signatory scheme with trusted partners.

Argent - Self-custody wallet, so claimed by Argent, without seed phrases. It is stated that the wallet is smart-contract based. It is not clear the definition of self-custody and who ultimately holds the private key of the EOA that deploys the smart contract wallet. 

Web3Auth - an enterprise-grade self-custody, so claimed by Web3Auth, wallet service which also recently released MPC.

Gnosis Safe - One of the most popular wallet platforms and is based on smart contracts.
