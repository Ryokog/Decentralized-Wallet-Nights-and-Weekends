# Cross-Chain-Wallet
A cross-chain wallet project using Connext for learning and building a portfolio.
This project will be built in the following phases;

1, Make a cross-chain transaction possible using `xcall` by Connext

2, Add a privacy feature

3, Add a KYC mechanism

I may also explore connexting to bridges for learning purposes.
